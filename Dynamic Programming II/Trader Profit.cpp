/********
Mike is a stock trader and makes a profit by buying and selling stocks. He buys a stock at a lower price and sells it at a higher price to book a profit. He has come to know the stock prices of a particular stock for n upcoming days in future and wants to calculate the maximum profit by doing the right transactions (single transaction = buying + selling). Can you help him maximize his profit?
Note: A transaction starts after the previous transaction has ended. Two transactions can't overlap or run in parallel.
The stock prices are given in the form of an array A for n days.
Given the stock prices and a positive integer k, find and print the maximum profit Mike can make in at most k transactions.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer q denoting the number of queries.

The first line of each test case contains a positive integer k, denoting the number of transactions. 

The second line of each test case contains a positive integer n, denoting the length of the array A.

The third line of each test case contains n space-separated positive integers, denoting the prices of each day in the array A.
Constraints
1<=q<=100

0<k<10

2<=n<=30

0<=elements of array A<=1000
Output Format
For each query print the maximum profit earned by Mike on a new line.
